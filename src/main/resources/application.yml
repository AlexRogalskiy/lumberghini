#  “Ah, ah, I almost forgot....I'm also going to need you to go ahead and come in on Sunday, too. We, uhhh, lost some people this week and we sorta need to play catch-up. Mmmmmkay? Thaaaaaanks.”
#
#Bill Lumbergh: Oooo...yeahhhh, ummm...I'm gonna have to go ahead and sort of disagree with you there. Yeah, uh, he's been real flaky lately, and I'm just not sure that he's the caliber person that we would want for upper management. He's also been having some problems with his TPS reports.
#
#Bill Lumbergh: Yeah, um, well, I'm just not sure about that right now.
#
#Bob Slydell: [Pulls Peter's file aside, showing Lumbergh's file next] Yeah, Bill, let me ask you a real quick question here: How much time would you say you spend each week dealing with these TPS reports?


#Peter Gibbons: What if we're still doin' this when we're 50?
#Samir: It would be nice to have that kind of job security.

#Samir: No, not again. I... why does it say paper jam when there is no paper jam? I swear to God, one of these days, I just kick this piece of shit out the window.
#Michael Bolton: You and me both, man. That thing is lucky I'm not armed.
#Samir: Piece of shit.

#  And I said, I don't care if they lay me off either, because I told, I told Bill that if they move my desk one more time, then, then I'm quitting, I'm going to quit. And, and I told Don too, because they've moved my desk four times already this year, and I used to be over by the window, and I could see the squirrels, and they were married... But then, they switched from the Swingline to the Boston stapler, but I kept my Swingline stapler because it didn't bind up as much, and I kept the staples for the Swingline stapler and it's not okay because if they take my stapler then I'll, I'll, I'll set the building on fire...

#  And then Mr. Lumbergh told me to talk to payroll and payroll told me to talk to Mr. Lumbergh and and and I still haven't received my paycheck and he took my stapler, and he never brought it back and then they moved my desk to storage room B and there was garbage on it, and I really don't appreciate garbage...

#  I was told that I could listen, to the radio at a reasonable volume from 9 to 11... well, I... I told Bill that if, if Sandra's going to listen to her headphones while she's, while she's filing then I should be able to listen to the radio while I'm collating so I don't see why I should have to turn it down because I enjoy, listening, at a reasonable volume, from 9 to 11...

#I'm thinking about taking that new chick from Logistics. If things go well I might be showing her my O-face. You know: Oh. Oh.
#
#  Milt, we're gonna need to go ahead and move you downstairs into storage B. We have some new people coming in, and we need all the space we can get. So if you could go ahead and pack up your stuff and move it down there, that would be terrific, mmmK?

#Outtakes during credits: Yeah if things go well I might have to take her for a ride on the Bone Coaster.

#  We don't have a lot of time on this earth. We weren't meant to spend it this way. Human beings were not meant to sit in little cubicles staring at computer screens all day, filling out useless forms and listening to eight different bosses drone on about mission statements.

#  Well, Ok. But... that's the last straw.
